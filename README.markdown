// Ajax Query
This was one of the toughest things I've done to date.  The query I came up with was referenced online by first getting the data from the JSON file and then passing it through a filter to check for those friends that were a part of the same Baby Step.  Once this was done I was able to pass a few different variables through the results to change the verbage depending on how many friends were a part of the same Baby Step.  

These steps are all indicated within the steps.js file

// Changing the content divs

I also used a javascript function to change the content blocks within each step.  This allowed me to incorporate some custom javascripting functions to incorporate a slight animation when switching between babysteps.  I also used the .hide and .show functions to change the highlighted babysteps icons.  

I did have a little trouble with the next step appearing for a split second before switching to the next BabyStep.  I was unable to figure this out in the allotted time.  Given more time I am confident that I could have figured this issue out.
